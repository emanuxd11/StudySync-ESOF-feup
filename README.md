## Best Idea (find name?)
> *name* is a personal and social study management app for FEUP students. (maybe write some more here) 

### Its features consist of:
- Planning group study sessions where students can define break times, place to meet up, study subject, goal exam, etc (maybe think of more features and hone it down to the best ones) 
- Keeping track of exam dates and notify users if there's a study group meeting up to study for an exam they also have 
- Keeping a study "diary" (maybe diary isn't the best word) where users can organize which topics they need to study, which ones they've already studied, etc
- Getting notifications about exams. This feature is similar to getting notifications about study groups, but only for exams. Maybe it would be interesting to disable, for instance, study group notifications for all courses or maybe just specific ones if the user isn't interested in the social aspect of the application.
