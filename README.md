## Best Idea (find name?)
> *name* is a personal study management app: 

### Its features consist of:
- planning group study sessions where students can define break times, place to meet up, study subject, goal exam, etc (maybe think of more features and hone it down to the best ones) 
- keeping track of exam dates and notify users if there's a study group meeting up to study for an exam they also have 
- keeping a study "diary" (maybe diary isn't the best word) where users can organize which topics they need to study, which ones they've already studied, etc
